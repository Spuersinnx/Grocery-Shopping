# Grocery-Shopping

The following application utilizes basic HTML elements and PHP to allow a user to shop for grocery items.

## How this application works:
* The user inputs their budget
* The user then selects the count for each item from the items available, and clicks on the submit button. The clear button resets the form
* The resulting PHP page then shows all item pictures, the count for each item, and the unit price in a tabular format, along with the total price, the tax calculated and the final price after taxes are applied
* A green message thanking the user is displayed at the bottom of the PHP result page, if the budget was not exceeded. If the budget was exceeded, a red warning message tells the user that their budget was exceeded
